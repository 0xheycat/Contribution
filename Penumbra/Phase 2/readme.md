Make a Coffe and wait until your Contribution accepted, 
Dont worry pcli will output your contribution hash after submission complete

i wanna close my screen without Disconnecting with pcli ? well just `CTRL+A+D`
You can check your contribution result

```bash
screen -x penumbra
```

After you hash 
plese input your contribution here (will update it when ready)

# Important
* The minimum bid for this ceremony is 60penumbra.
Once in the queue, you just have to wait until the command completes. Grabe your Coffe with Cat ðŸ’•
* Posting your contribution hash publicly allows others to verify that your contribution was included in the transcript!
* Reconnecting and Rebidding
 To change your bid, you can simply run the command again with a different bid amount. Note that each time you bid with the command above, this adds additional funds to all of the previous bids you've already submitted.
If you get disconnected for some reason, you can simply bid 0penumbra and recover your position in the queue, since all of your previous bids have been recorded.

Thank you
