Make a coffee and wait until your contribution is accepted. Don't worry, PCLI will output your contribution hash after submission is complete.

If you want to close your screen without disconnecting from PCLI, simply use CTRL+A+D. You can check your contribution result by using

```bash
screen -x penumbra
```

After you receive your hash, please input your contribution here (will update when ready).

Important:
- The minimum bid for this ceremony is 60 penumbra. Once in the queue, you just have to wait until the command completes. Grab your coffee with Cat ðŸ’•
Posting your contribution hash publicly allows others to verify that your contribution was included in the transcript!

- Reconnecting and Rebidding:
To change your bid, you can simply run the command again with a different bid amount. Note that each time you bid with the command above, this adds additional funds to all of the previous bids you've already submitted.
- If you get disconnected for some reason, you can simply bid 0 penumbra and recover your position in the queue, since all of your previous bids have been recorded.
Thank you.
